## 🎯 Project Origin & Agentic Vision

This project was initially conceived and developed as part of the **`payman`**, showcasing a robust **`paymanai`** for intelligent knowledge retrieval and generation. Our vision was to build an autonomous AI agent capable of:

- **🧠 Intelligent Information Retrieval**: Acting as a smart agent to fetch, process, and synthesize information from diverse sources (documents, URLs, live web).
- **🚀 Dynamic Query Routing**: Intelligently deciding between local knowledge base retrieval and real-time web search based on query intent.
- **💡 Autonomous Knowledge Management**: Providing a self-contained system for building and querying a dynamic knowledge base.

This system embodies the principles of agentic AI, offering a powerful, self-sufficient solution for complex information needs.
